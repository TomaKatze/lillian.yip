## About me 

### My innovation and transformation journey

After earning my Master’s degree in Design Management in the UK, I joined Nestlé and Mars as an Innovation Manager in Greater China. Here, I spearheaded exciting innovation projects, blending creativity with strategic thinking to bring fresh ideas to life.

" During my time in Mainland China, I took a leap into entrepreneurship by launching my own startup, dedicated to helping organizations drive their innovation initiatives. For three years, I embraced the challenges and triumphs of the startup world, fueling my passion for transformative ideas."

As a experienced Design Thinking coach, I thrive on running and facilitating workshops, empowering teams to think outside the box and embrace innovation. Currently, I’m supporting a local developer in their digital and cultural transformation journey, leveraging my expertise to foster a dynamic and adaptive workforce.

In addition to my practical experience, I hold a Prosci Change Management certification, equipping me with the tools to guide organizations through change effectively.
